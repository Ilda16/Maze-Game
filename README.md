# Maze-Game
Objective:

The player must find a lever to unlock the exit.

Once the lever is pulled, the player has 20 seconds to reach the exit before it closes.

An enemy roams the maze, trying to find and attack the player.

The player can attack the enemy to temporarily disable it, causing it to respawn elsewhere.

The enemy can also attack the player, reducing their health or causing a game over.
